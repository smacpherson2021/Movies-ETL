# Movies-ETL

## Overview:

This project creates an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the approriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
The code uses a function that takes in three files - Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens ratings data, and performs the ETL process by 
adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
